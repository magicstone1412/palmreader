## Download pre-built latest release & run as an application

> Coming soon!

## Prerequisites

Palm Reader (and hsd) require nodejs v16 or greater.
You must also have python and build tools installed for node-gyp to build native modules.

### Copy to clipboard

For "copy" functionality you must have `pbcopy`, `xsel` or `xclip` installed on
your system. Widgets with copy functions also have the option to export text
to a file as an alternative.

**OSX:** `brew install pbcopy`

**Linux:** `apt install xsel`

### Copy and Paste over SSH

For server: 

- Make sure that `X11Forwarding yes` must specified in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` (default on Debian\Ubuntu).

- Must have `xsel` or `xclip` installed on your system.

- X11 on Debian/Ubuntu: `$ sudo apt install xauth xfonts-base`

For client: 

- Must support X11 forwarding, for example Putty or MobaXterm.

Usage:

 `copy`: click on the content.

 `paste`: press `SHIFT or CTRL + Right Click` on SSH window.

### Ledger

Ledger requires additional drivers and permissions on Linux.

**Linux:** `apt install pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev`

[Also be sure to set up udev rules for Ledger:](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-USB-connection-issues-with-Ledger-Live?support=true)

```
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules/master/add_udev_rules.sh | sudo bash
```

## Installation

### Install globally using npm

*If you get permissions errors installing global nodejs packages,
do **not** just use `sudo`, [fix the problem instead.](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally)*

`npm install -g hsd palmreader`

### Install locally using git (for contributing developers)

Clone and install as global node modules:

```
git clone https://github.com/handshake-org/hsd
cd hsd
npm i
npm i -g
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/pinheadmz/palmreader
cd palmreader
npm i --prod
npm i -g
```

**The `--prod` flag is important here!**

## Usage

With hsd and Palm Reader both installed as global nodejs packages, run:

`hsd --plugins palmreader`

Notice that hsd is still the main process and Palm Reader is added as a plug-in.
This means your hsd node remains [fully configurable](https://hsd-dev.org/guides/config.html),
and ALL configurations "should be" compatible with Palm Reader.

Examples:

```
hsd --plugins palmreader --spv --no-dns --api-key sandwich
hsd --plugins palmreader --network regtest --index-tx --index-address --prefix ~/.config/Bob/hsd_data
hsd --plugins palmreader --log-level spam
```

## Build executable

We use [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg) to create an executable that bundles
nodejs itself along with hsd and Palm Reader scripts.

This time, remove the `--prod` flag after cloning from git:

```
cd palmreader
npm i
npm run build
```

Executable will be compiled to the `build/` directory.

## Dependencies

Due to the sensitivity of cryptocurrency software to dependency risk, only
software written by The Handshake Developers is required by Palm Reader.
